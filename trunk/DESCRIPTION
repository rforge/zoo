Title: Z's ordered observations
Author: Achim Zeileis, Gabor Grothendieck
Maintainer: Achim Zeileis <Achim.Zeileis@wu-wien.ac.at>
Description: An S3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed
             observations. It is particularly aimed at irregular
	     time series of numeric vectors/matrices.
	     zoo's key design goals are independence of a particular
             index/date/time class and consistency (to the extent possible)
             with ts and base R by providing methods to standard generics.
