FEATURES
********

  o zoo()
    - support zoo factor objects

    - support zoo data.frame objects

    
  o merge()
    - merge.zoo to accept non-zoo arguments (other than first)
      if all zoo args have same index and all args have same
      NROW value.  In that case the non-zoo args are to be given
      the common index by default.

    - allow a scalar non-zoo element as an argument to merge.zoo in
      which case it cbinds a constant zoo column to the same merge
      that would have been created without the scalar. [GG: Not sure we
      really need this but I put it down so I would not forget.]

  o [.zoo [<-.zoo
    - allow indexing by index, i.e., datetime argument


  o misc functions
    - data= argument in dynlm

    - get runmed working with NAs, add runmax, consolidate and
      generalize runmean, runmax, runmed and runmad

    - interface to additional statistical routines such as the ones
      referenced in:
      http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-refcard-ts.pdf

    - irregular to regular conversion routines [Z: the following
      functions would be nice as.ts.zoo() is.regular()]

    - interpolation


  o QA
    - regression test suite

    - additional use and testing



INTERFACES
**********

  o generic functions:
    - ask R-core to make order() and match() generic,
      and also na.contiguous()
    
    - new generics in zoo which could go to stats or base:
      value, value<-, na.locf, window<-

  o investigate whether there are alternative
    primitives that already have standard generics in the core
    that could be used in place of order and match. Is a
    smaller set of primitives possible?

  o move as.its.zoo over to its

  o provide fBasics interface routine to the Rmetrics projects



DOCUMENTATION & COMMUNICATION
*****************************

  o Vignette(s), JSS paper, R news article [Z: something is on the
    way here]

  o some data to include with zoo

  o more examples for the help files

  o FAQ
  
  o pdf one page reference card which lists all functions
    available [Z: closes thing available is currently
    ?zoo]

  o what facilities does the R project provide to subprojects for 
    mailing lists, web space, wiki, forum, etc.

  o additional developers
